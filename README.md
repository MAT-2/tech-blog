# Description

Module 14 - A project for creating a blog-site using full stack functionality.

# Summary

Building a website that uses a login feature and creating new posts within a tech blog was a lot of fun, yet challenging. The challenges that I faced was creating the login feature, as well as creating tech blog posts and showing them on the website.
